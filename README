sfDoctrineRowLevelAccessBehavior plugin
==============

The `sfDoctrineRowLevelAccessBehavior` is a symfony plugin that adds 
authorization on a per row basis; also known als Row Level Access or 
Record Level Access.

This plugin provides you the means to enable Row Level Access in your 
application by maintaining just a configuration file. The rest is done
automatically.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfDoctrineRowLevelAccessBehavior

  * Clear your cache
  
        $ symfony cc

  * Create a new YML file in your /config folder named `rla.yml`
  
Setting up Row Level Access
---------------------------

With this plugin you can create an association between a field in a model 
and a method in your user class. The general idea behind this is that that which
the user may view is limited by his properties.

For example:
The currently signed on user may only see the Contacts of the Customer he 
represents. To be able to make this relation you would need a method 
getCustomerId in the myUser class and 3 lines in the configuration file 
rla.yml, which look like this
           
           $ Contact:
           $   field: costumer_id
           $   callback: { method: getCustomerId }

What this code does is create a relation between the CUSTOMER_ID field of 
the Contact model and that which is returned from `myUser->getCustomerId()`.
Thus, if `getCustomerId` returns 1, only the records where CUSTOMER_ID is equal 
to 1 are returned in the Contact model.

  * `field`: name of the field in the model where the behavior supposed to check against. default is: id. Is this is not set, the behaviour checks against the id. 
  * `callback`: What against to you want to check. Is a object with two extra options:
   * `class`: name of the class you want to check against. Standard is a special value of SF_USER of the user object. It can be also a clas with a static method.
   * `method`: the name of the method which returns the values for the check. If it returns NULL everything is permitted, otherwise it returns a value or an array. Except for the SF_USER this has to be static for the handed over classes ($sf_user supports non-static).



Associating multiple values
---------------------------
Situations occur where you want to use multiple values to check against. 
For example when the user is allowed to see the information of multiple 
customers.

This can be solved by returning an array from the User's method, thus if 
the `getCustomerId` returns `array(1,2)` instead of `1` the user will be 
associated with both customers.
